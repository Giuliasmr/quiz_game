      // HOW TO calculate the result
      // You can do it in 2 ways:
      // If you are presenting all questions together, just take all the radio buttons and check if the selected answer === correct_answer
      // If you are presenting one question at a time, just add one point or not to the user score if the selected answer === correct_answer
